1. Which programming languages are you most comfortable working with? Why?
- JavaScript. The reason is it give me all I need with less hurdle compare to others such as Java, Haskell, PHP, Python.
As long as I know what I am doing then extension like TypeScript is as good as trash.
The asynchronous was supported by design from the language stand-point while others language need extra work to obtain such thing.
It easy to approach, wherever the browser can operate, the JavaScript is available (not apply for some weird browser such as Surf).
2. Any Mobile programming experiences? If yes, please cite examples and name the languages you are familiar with.
- I used to build an Android application. It's a project since university which act as a dictionary and contain build-in game to help user learn new vocabulary.
I don't really remember the language but Android Studio is the IDE I used at that time.
3. Do you have DevOPS experience? If yes, please cite examples and name some best practices.
- I don't really know exactly how you guys define the DevOps role. But in previous job, I do ton of work related to the server (Develope and Integration server)
which include automate deployment, server configuration, ... Beside, I have been using Linux for years and be able to get the most out of it so work with server is just as familiar as
work with my own laptop/desktop.
4. Do you have cloud computing setup experience? If yes, please name the service providers you are familiar with.
- If cloud computing you mention is something similar with AWS then my answer is "no". But if you mean Kubernetes + Docker as CRI then my answer is "yes".
From my previous project, I handle the setup of Kubernetes in all the server at hand include my own desktop.
5. What process do you use to review application codes?
- I keep it really simple. If the problem is complicate then I will ask the author to explain for me the solution and I will review the source code later (read pull request).
If the problem is simple then no explaination needed, I just read the pull request and provide my opinion(if any).
6. What do you consider to be the most important criteria for the success of a software development?
- That is the level of understanding, the deeper the better. The software must serve customer need so make it right from the first time is top priority.
That is when prototype play the role which show customer how it look/act when they receive the final output.
